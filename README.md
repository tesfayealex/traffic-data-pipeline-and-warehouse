## Introduction

<p>
A city traffic department wants to collect traffic data using swarm UAVs (drones) from a number of locations in the city and use the data collected for improving traffic flow in the city and for a number of other undisclosed projects. Your startup is responsible for creating a scalable data warehouse that will host the vehicle trajectory data extracted by analysing footage taken by swarm drones and static roadside cameras.The data warehouse should take into account future needs, organise data such that a number of downstream projects query the data efficiently. You should use the Extract Load Transform (ELT) framework using DBT.
</p>

## Included-Technologies-and-tools

<p>
Apache Airflow - A workflow manager to schedule, orchestrate & monitor workflows. Directed acyclic graphs (DAG) are used by Airflow to control workflow orchestration.
</p>
<p>
Postgresql - is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. It is used as the primary data 
store or data warehouse for many webs, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.
</p>
<p>
DBT (data build tool) - enables transforming data in warehouses by simply writing select statements. It handles turning these select statements into tables and views.
</p>
<p>
Redash - is an open-source web application. It's used for clearing databases and visualizing the results.
